## üé® Design Guidelines

If suggesting visual changes:

### Aesthetic Principles

- **Color Palette**: Stick to the existing rainy town colors
  - Primary: Cool grays (#646c7d, #879a9a)
  - Accents: Warm oranges/yellows (#f9a749, #f1bc08)
  - Supporting: Blues and purples (#456dc3, #5b43b3)
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts that feel welcoming
- **Animations**: Subtle, purposeful motion that enhances UX
- **Layout**: Clean, organized interfaces with plenty of whitespace

### User Experience

- **Consistency**: All sections should feel like part of the same application
- **Accessibility**: Consider users with different abilities and devices
- **Performance**: Features should be responsive and fast
- **Intuitive**: New users should be able to understand features quickly

## üîß Technical Considerations

### Code Style

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: We prefer pure JS over frameworks for simplicity
- **ES6+**: Modern JavaScript features are encouraged
- **Comments**: Code should be well-documented
- **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### File Organization

- Keep HTML, CSS, and JS files organized by feature
- Maintain the existing file naming convention
- CSS should be modular and well-structured
- JavaScript should use classes and modern patterns

### Browser Support

- Target modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Ensure mobile compatibility
- Test across different screen sizes
- Consider performance on lower-end devices
